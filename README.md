# Emotionless-Snake

This game is written using face-API.
Make sure you are in a very lit place before you start.

The point of the game is to ***tran your fake expressions***.

The rules are simple:
	The snake game. With one little twist. Instead of using your arrows to move, every time the game starts it randomly tells you
	which emotion triggers which snake direction. Therefor, every time you create an expression, camera detects it and 
	moves the snake in the direction. Try it and see how many points can you score.
	
	Whenever you want to reset the game, just say "reset" and , since the game has implemented speech recognition, 
	the game will reset and directions will reset linked emotions; you can see everything you speak on the sides.
